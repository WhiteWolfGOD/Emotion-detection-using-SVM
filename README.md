# Emotion Detection using SVM

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect emotions from a given dataset of labeled images or text. The SVM model classifies the input data into various emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc., based on the features extracted from the dataset.

## Project Overview

Emotion detection is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction, providing insights into users' feelings, opinions, and behavior. This project utilizes SVM, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm, due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its robustness in classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is obtained from [Dataset Source, if applicable, e.g., Kaggle](#). It consists of labeled samples for different emotions, which have been preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the SVM model.

## Project Structure

- **data/** - Contains the dataset files used in the project.
- **notebooks/** - Jupyter notebooks with data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.
- **models/** - Saved models and relevant model configuration files.
- **src/** - Source code files for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`

To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Data was cleaned, normalized, and split into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Feature extraction techniques were applied to highlight characteristics essential for emotion classification.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A Support Vector Machine classifier was used to train the model on the training dataset.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the model's performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model was evaluated on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Confusion matrices and other visualizations were generated to assess the model's performance.

## Usage

To train the model, run:
```python
python src/train.py
```

To evaluate the model, use:
```python
python src/evaluate.py
```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying emotions accurately. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided in the `results/` folder.
